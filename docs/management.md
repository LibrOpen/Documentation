## Project Workflow

### Steps

1. **Define Objectives for a Feature (EPICs):** Identify the main goal of a feature via an EPIC.
2. **Break Down EPIC into User Stories:** Segment the EPIC into smaller functionalities expressed as User Stories.
3. **List User Stories on GitHub Projects:** Create one or more tickets for each User Story.
4. **Explain and Assign Tickets:** Add tickets to the backlog for the current or next sprint, with necessary details and assignments.


## Defining EPICs

EPICs represent the main features defined before starting the project or after team discussions.

- **Purpose:** EPICs guide the sprint’s direction, aiming to complete them within one or two sprints of two weeks each.
- **Example:** An EPIC for creating a chat feature between users.

Each EPIC is divided into smaller User Stories.

## Defining User Stories

User Stories are segments of an EPIC, representing small, user-centric functionalities.

- **User-Centric Approach:** Place yourself in the user’s position to ensure a focus on user experience.
  
  Example for the chat EPIC:
  - *As a user, I can see a Chat page.*

- **Purpose:** User Stories form the actionable tasks for developers.
- **Completion:** An EPIC is closed when all its User Stories are completed.
- **Time Management:**
  - Assign an estimated time for each User Story.
  - Track the actual time spent by developers.
  - Use this data to compare estimated vs. actual time at the EPIC’s conclusion.

## Creating Tickets

After defining User Stories, translate them into tickets on GitHub Projects (Kanban).

- **Placement:** Add tickets to the backlog and name them based on their corresponding User Story.
- **Sprint Start:** At the beginning of a sprint linked to an EPIC, refine tickets by adding details:
  - Technical steps
  - Explanations if necessary
  - Design screenshots if applicable
  - Sprint priority
  - Assignees if possible
  - Estimated time
  - Relevant stack labels (e.g., Frontend, Backend)

## Refining Tickets

Tickets in the "Backlog Refined" column are discussed at the start of each sprint during the Monday team meeting.

- **Purpose:**
  - Clarify ticket details.
  - Assign tickets if team members volunteer.

## Group Management

### Weekly Meetings

Held every Monday at 5 PM (French time). Topics include:

1. Review work from the past week.
2. Plan tasks for the current week.
3. Discuss current or upcoming sprint tickets (refinement).
4. Address specific topics (e.g., design, tech, DevOps).

### Work Sessions

Collaborative work sessions are organized on:

- Weekends
- Wednesday or Thursday

These sessions may involve voice calls for better coordination.
